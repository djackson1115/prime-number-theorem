# prime-number-theorem

## Motivation
To provide an introduction for topics in analytic number theory using intutive expositions and visuals.

## Installation
Install Python 3.9 or later and load the following packages.
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
A copy of Wolfram Mathematica 12.3 or later is required, you may be able to get a free license as a university student/instructor.

## Files
- ```PrimeCountingFunction.nb``` Mathematica code creating visualizations for several estimates of the prime-counting function.
- ```prime_counting_function.ipynb ``` Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to implement the prime-counting function using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
- ```primenumbertheorem_paper.pdf``` Excerpts from a capstone project containing proofs, visualizations, and exposition about the prime number theorem and related topics in number theory.
